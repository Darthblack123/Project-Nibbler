# Project Nibbler
Open source pick and place object assembler add-on to the Ender 5 pro 3D printer.  
https://research.avenues.org/moonshots/project-nibbler/
## Introduction 
Nibbler is a pick-and-place add-on to the Ender 5 pro that can build and assemble 3D objects from building block "pucks". 

This repository contains everything needed to set up a Nibbler machine from scratch. 
## Project Status
This repository represents the culmination of four years of work on Project Nibbler done by four generations of Avenues students from Sao Paolo, Brazil and New York, USA.

## Ender 5 pro setup
The Nibbler pick and place machine is an add-on to the Ender 5 pro. The following modifications must be made to a stock Ender 5: 
### 
The Creality Ender 5 Pro is the 3D Printer base that we are hacking and customizing to be able to print with nibbles and binder matrix.
