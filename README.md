# Project Nibbler
Open source pick and place object assembler add-on to the Ender 5 pro 3D printer.  
## Introduction 
Nibbler is a pick and place add-on to the Ender 5 pro that can build and assemble 3D objects from building block "pucks". 

household appliance that can receive any solid waste material, grind it into fine particulates, and then combine those particulates with a binding agent, making the mix suitable for casting or 3d-printing. This process eliminates the need for centralized collection of solid solid-waste materials, providing an economically compelling and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional recycling. The Nibbler system is U.S. patent pending 63/042,126.
